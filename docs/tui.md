# UI Design

The application will present a single-screen dashboard with a classic blue background, organized into several key, always-visible panes.

## 1. Overall Layout

The screen is divided into four main sections:

1. **Header Bar (Top):** A slim, single-line bar at the very top.
2. **Data Pipeline Pane (Top-Left/Main):** The largest and most detailed pane.
3. **JAX Training Status Pane (Right):** A pane dedicated to live training metrics.
4. **Log Pane (Bottom):** A pane for displaying raw log output.

## 2. Header Bar

This bar provides high-level, global status at a glance.

- **Uptime:** Total wall-clock time since the script was launched.
- **Overall Stage:** The current high-level state of the application. Will display one of: `WAITING FOR DATA`, `TRAINING`, `EXPORTING`, or `ERROR`.

### 3. Data Pipeline Pane

This pane visualizes the flow of data through the C++ pipeline. The new
design is a vertically scrollable list where every stage and queue consumes
one row (two only when extra detail is needed). Rows are rendered in the same
order as traffic flows through the loader, preserving the mental model of the
pipeline without relying on borders or grid positioning.

- **Pipeline Stages (Rows):** Each stage of the C++ pipeline is rendered as a
  single line.
  - **Stage Heading:** We show the friendly stage name followed by the proto
    field key in square brackets, for example `Chunk source loader
    [chunk_source_loader]`.
  - **Load Metrics:** Stages with thread pools render load in `load
    active/total` format.
  - **Specific Stats:** When a stage has additional data we append short
    segments separated by `|`, e.g. skipped file counts or pool sizes. Extra
    detail spills onto an indented second line when required.

- **Queues (Rows):** Each stage row is followed by a queue row that surfaces the
  metrics of the outgoing queue.
  - **Queue Heading:** The row title includes the stage name and proto key plus
    the queue name when provided, for example `Chunk source loader queue
    [chunk_source_loader] (queue output)`.
  - **Throughput:** 1-second rate in `items/s`.
  - **Totals:** Total items transferred, formatted with apostrophes.
  - **Fill State:** Average queue fullness displayed as `avg / capacity`. If the
    queue does not report either value we keep the placeholder `--` to avoid
    misinterpretation.

- **Train/Validation/Test Splitter:**
  - The pipeline view will show a "Stream Splitter" stage.
  - Hotkeys (e.g., F1, F2, F3) will allow the user to instantly switch the view
  - After this stage, the UI will display the pipeline stats for **one** stream
    at a time (defaulting to 'Training'). to show the stats for the 'Training',
    'Validation', or 'Test' streams.

### 4. Training schedule/pipeline pane

The area below the Data Pipeline Pane is split horizontally into two
sections: Training Schedule (left) and JAX Training Status (right).

The Training Schedule pane shows:

- **Combined uptime and stage line**: "Uptime: 2d 14:30:45   Stage: TRAINING"
  - Uptime includes days when >24 hours (format: "2d 14:30:45")
  - Stage shows current training state (WAITING_FOR_DATA, TRAINING, EXPORTING, ERROR)
- **Completed epochs**: Simple counter of epochs completed since daemon start
- **New chunks progress bar**: Shows chunks collected since training start vs. target
  - Indeterminate state when target is unknown (0)
- **Training time progress bar**: Current training time vs. previous training duration
  - Indeterminate state when no previous duration exists
- **Cycle time progress bar**: Current cycle time vs. previous cycle duration
  - Indeterminate state when no previous duration exists

**Implementation details:**

- **Header bar**: Completely empty (no content)
- **Data structure**: `TrainingScheduleData` dataclass with all timing fields:
  - `current_stage: TrainingStage` (enum)
  - `completed_epochs_since_start: int`
  - `new_chunks_since_training_start: int`
  - `chunks_to_wait: int`
  - `total_uptime_seconds: float`
  - `current_training_time_seconds: float`
  - `previous_training_time_seconds: float`
  - `current_cycle_time_seconds: float`
  - `previous_cycle_time_seconds: float`
- **Timing computation**: All timing values computed in daemon, not TUI
- **Progress bars**: Show indeterminate state when maximum values â‰¤ 0
- **Layout**: Compact single-line widgets with no extra padding/margins
- **Files**:
  - `training_widgets.py`: Widget implementations
  - `pipeline.py`: Training state tracking and data collection
  - `daemon.py`: Metrics collection and transmission
  - `messages.py`: Protocol definitions with enum serialization support

### 5. JAX Training Status Pane

This pane is dedicated to the live status of an active JAX training run. It
remains blank or shows summary info when the system is not actively training.

- **Epoch Progress:** A progress bar showing completion of the current epoch
  (`Step 12345 / 50000`).
- **Performance Metrics:**
  - Steps per second: `345.6 steps/s`.
  - Estimated Time Remaining (ETR) for the current run.
  - Total wall time spent on the current training run.
- **Loss Values (Numerical Only):**
  - A prominent display of the **Total Loss**.
  - A compact 2-column grid displaying the individual values for the **7 Head
    Losses**.

### 6. Log Pane

A pane across the bottom of the screen.

- **Content:** A direct feed of all output sent to `stderr` from any part of the
  application (Python or C++).
- **Functionality:** The pane will be scrollable and will hold a fixed number of
  lines (e.g., 1000) to prevent unbounded memory usage, discarding the oldest
  lines as new ones arrive.
