# Suggestions for discovery* files

This document provides style and design suggestions for the `discovery.cc`, `discovery.h`, and `discovery_main.cc` files. The goal is to make the code more elegant, concise, idiomatic, and maintainable.

## Design and Abstraction Suggestions

### 1. Simplify Watch Descriptor Mappings

In `FileDiscovery`, two maps are used to manage `inotify` watch descriptors: `watch_descriptors_` (`wd` -> `directory_path`) and `directory_watches_` (`directory_path` -> `wd`). This is redundant. A single map from `wd` to `path` is sufficient. The reverse lookup is not strictly necessary if the logic is structured carefully.

**Proposed Change:**

- Remove `directory_watches_`.
- When a directory is deleted, iterate through `watch_descriptors_` to find the `wd` associated with the path and its subdirectories. This might seem less efficient, but directory deletions are infrequent, and it simplifies the data structures.

### 2. Streamline Initial File Discovery and Monitoring

The `AddDirectory` function currently performs an initial scan and then relies on the `MonitorThread` for ongoing updates. This is a good separation of concerns, but the implementation can be cleaner.

**Proposed Change:**

- The initial scan in `AddDirectory` can be moved to a separate private method to improve clarity.
- The batching of notifications for the initial scan can be handled by the same mechanism as the ongoing monitoring, reducing code duplication.

### 3. Generic Notification Batching

The batching of notifications is implemented in both `AddDirectory` and `MonitorThread`. This logic can be extracted into a separate helper function to avoid repetition.

**Example:**

```cpp
// In FileDiscovery class
void NotifyObserversInBatches(std::span<const File> files) {
    const size_t batch_size = 10000;
    for (size_t i = 0; i < files.size(); i += batch_size) {
        size_t end = std::min(i + batch_size, files.size());
        std::span<const File> batch(files.data() + i, end - i);
        NotifyObservers(batch);
    }
}
```

### 4. Robust Error Handling

The current error handling uses `LOG(ERROR)` and returns. This is reasonable, but for a library, it might be better to propagate errors to the caller, perhaps by changing the return types of functions like `AddDirectory` to return a `bool` or a `status` object.

**Example:**

```cpp
// In discovery.h
[[nodiscard]] bool AddDirectory(const std::string& directory, Observer initial_observer);

// In discovery.cc
bool FileDiscovery::AddDirectory(...) {
    // ...
    if (ec) {
        LOG(ERROR) << "Failed to scan directory " << directory << ": " << ec.message();
        return false;
    }
    // ...
    return true;
}
```

### 5. Simplify `MonitorThread` Logic

The `MonitorThread` has a loop that processes events in cycles. This can be simplified. The `epoll_wait` can be used with a timeout, and the event processing can be done in a single block.

**Proposed Change:**

- Use a longer timeout for `epoll_wait` to avoid busy-waiting.
- Process all available `inotify` events in a single loop after `epoll_wait` returns, rather than the fixed number of cycles. This will be more efficient when there are many events.

By implementing these suggestions, the `FileDiscovery` class can be made more robust, maintainable, and easier to understand.


## Style Suggestions

### 6. Use `using` for Type Aliases

In `discovery.h`, the type aliases for `Token` and `Observer` are clear, but this could be extended for other complex types to improve readability.

**Example:**

```cpp
// In discovery.h
using WatchDescriptorMap = absl::flat_hash_map<int, std::string>;
using DirectoryWatchMap = absl::flat_hash_map<std::string, int>;
```

### 7. Simplify Lambda Expressions

In `discovery_main.cc`, the lambda expressions are straightforward but can be slightly simplified.

**Example:**

The lambda in `RegisterObserver` can be written more concisely.

```cpp
// In discovery_main.cc
discovery.RegisterObserver([](auto files) {
    for (const auto& file : files) {
        std::cout << "File Discovered: " << file.filepath << std::endl;
    }
});
```

### 8. Consistent `const` and Reference Usage

Ensure that `const` is used wherever possible to prevent unintended modifications and to allow the compiler to optimize more effectively. Use references to avoid unnecessary copies of objects. The existing code is already quite good in this regard, but a consistent check is always beneficial.
